Palmitoyl hexapeptide-12,,Palmitoyl hexapeptide-12 (Fig.1) [Gottschalck and Breslawec 2012] is a signal peptide which affects fibroblasts by increasing their number or collagen production and inhibiting further collagen hydrolysis. This action is effective -that is halts or slows down the aging process it is known that aged skin is characterized by reduced levels of collagen and elastin [Kamoun et al.1995; Robinson et al. 2005; Gorouhi and Maibach 2009; Abu Samah and Heard 2011].,,C38H68N6O8,737,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)NC(C(C)C)C(=O)NCC(=O)NC(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(C)C(=O)N1CCCC1C(=O)NCC(=O)O,171263-26-6,

DAPTOMYCIN,Streptomyces roseosporus,,"Daptomycin has a distinct mechanism of action, in which it binds to bacterial membrane and causes rapid depolarization of the cell membrane due to calcium-dependant potassium efflux; the loss of membrane potential leads to inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, resulting in bacterial cell death.

Malacidin B,,"Malacidin B, along with Malacidin A, is a member of a class of chemicals made by bacteria found in soil that can kill Gram-positive bacteria 1. Malacidins are 10-member macrocycle lipopeptides discovered via gene sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. While structurally similar to other macrocycle drugs like Daptomycin and Friulimicin B, Malacidin B appears to act via its own distinct mechanism.","Malacidin B appears to bind Lipid II via a calcium dependent mechanism despite the absence of the typical Asp-X-Asp-Gly motif associate with calcium binding. The structure of Malacidin B includes a 3-hydroxy-aspartate residue while the ""X"" variable spacer residue is absent. It is unknown how these unique structural features may impact the drug's mechanism of action. The binding of Malacidin B to Lipid II prevents the incorporation of the subunit into the cell wall, disrupting synthesis and likely resulting in death of the bacterial cell. Malacidin B does not appear to form pores nor does it seem to integrate into the cell wall. While this mechanism is similar to that of Vancomycin, Malacidin B retains its activity against Vancomycin-resistant pathogens. Unlike other antibiotic agents, Malacidin B also retains its activity in the presence of pulmonary surfactants.",C57H90N12O20,1263.4,CCC(C)CCC=CC=CC(=O)NC(C(C)C(=O)O)C(=O)NC1C(NC(=O)C2CC(CN2C(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)CNC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC(=O)C(NC1=O)C(C)C)CCCCN)C(C(=O)O)O)CC(=O)O)C(C)C(=O)O)C(C)C)C)C,,
